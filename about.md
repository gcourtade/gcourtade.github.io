This is my personal blog.

My main research interest is using NMR and simulations to gain a better understanding of how proteins work. 

During my master's and PhD, I worked with a family of enzymes known as lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs). The focus has been on studying functional aspects of LPMOs by NMR and biochemical methods. So far, I've dwelled in studying protein-carbohydrate and protein-protein interactions, determining the pKa of specific amino acids in a protein, and investigating protein dynamics by NMR.

Currently, I am a PostDoc with a grant from the Novo Nordisk Foundation. I am studying multi-domain proteins with NMR, simulations and other biophysical and biochemical techniques to try to understand the interplay between the folded domains and the role of linker regions. 

During these scientific pursuits, I've  stumbled upon interesting and fun to solve technical challenges that rarely come out to light as part of a paper. The aim of this blog is thus to show both the science and the strugles behind it.
