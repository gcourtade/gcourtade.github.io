This is my personal website.

My main research interest is using NMR to gain a better understanding of the biochemistry of proteins.

During my master's and PhD, I worked with a family of enzymes known as lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs). The focus has been on studying functional aspects of LPMOs by NMR and other methods. So far, I've dwelled in studying protein-carbohydrate and protein-protein interactions, determining the pKa of specific amino acids in a protein, and investigating protein dynamics by NMR.

Currently, I am working on studying multi-domain LPMOs to try to understand the interplay between the catalytic domain, the carbohydrate-binding module and the linker region.

During these scientific pursuits, I've  stumbled upon interesting and fun to solve technical challenges that rarely come out to light as part of a paper. The aim of this blog is thus to show both the science and the troubles behind it.
