My first [(assignment) paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12104-020-09986-z) as a last author was published today! It is also the first ever paper by Idd, who I am glad to be supervising in her PhD. She's doing new NMR work on lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs), like JdLPMO10A, one of the smallest known LPMOs. 

Sorry that the paper is not Open Access, but you can let me know if you would like to look at the protein NMR data and I'll send you a PDF.
