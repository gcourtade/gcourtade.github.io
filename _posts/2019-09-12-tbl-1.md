excerpt: About my recent experience with TBL
---

This semester I am lecturing biochemistry for the second time ever. Last year I opted for giving traditional lectures, where I presented and explained concepts for 2x45 min. The most interaction we had was me asking sporadic questions to a confused classroom. 

After attending a [very interesting course](https://falkr.github.io/tbl/) on Team-Based Learning (TBL) by Frank Kraemer, I decided to implement some of those concepts in my new lectures.

### What is TBL? ###

#### Teams ####
The central aspect of TBL is that students work in teams of 5-7 students formed by the teacher. The teams should stay constant throughout the semester. Moreover, a part of the final grade consists on the team members grading each other.

### Course Design ####
<p align="center">![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/tbl-unit.png)</p>
1. **Preparation.** Students prepare individually by using a number of resources (book chapters, videos, etc.)
2. **Readiness Assurance.** The level of preparation is tested first by an individual test, and then by the exact same test taken in groups. After the tests, the instructor can focus on the concepts that are most unclear or difficult, by going through them in the form of a short (ca. 20 min) lecture.
3. **Team Application Activities.** Groups go through a number of activities where they apply knowledge gathered during preparation. The level of difficulty should be high and the tasks should be relevant and specific.


### My implementation of TBL ###
### The course ###
* The course I am teaching is divided in three sections, with one teacher for each section. This means that I am responsible for 1/3 of the course, with one class at the beginning of the semester, and 6 classes at the end.
* The evaluation format of the course had been decided beforehand and it is not straight-forward to change this or the overall format of the course.
* Lectures are not mandatory, students are free to not come to any lectures. This means that it is impossible to predict who will show up. 

#### Teams ####
Because of the reasons outlined above, it was not possible to create the teams myself. Instead, I assigned teams according to how the students were sitting down on the first lecture. This is not optimal, as they are likely to sit with their friends. As a result, the diversity of backgrounds within the groups - likely the single main benefit of group formed by the teacher - is lost.

Aware of these limitations, I chose to move on and design group exercises.

#### 1. Preparation ####
Students were instructed to read certain pages from the book, and they were informed that there would be a test on the material during the next lecture.

#### 2. Readiness Assurance ####
I prepared a multiple-choice quiz using Google Forms, using questions from the Instructor Resources that accompany the textbook either directly or with my own modifications. 

During the lecture, in order to share the quiz with the students, I made a code-redirect website where the students can type a code, which redirects them to the respective Google Form.

<p align="center">![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/code-redirect.png)</p>


The HTML code: 
```html
<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<form method="post" id="TEST" action="javascript:;" onsubmit="myFunction(this)">
<input type="text" id="command" tabindex="1" placeholder="1234">
<input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

The JavaScript code: 
```
function myFunction(e) {
      }
      if ($('#command').val() === "1998") {
        window.location = "https://www.google.com/";
      }
      return false;
}
```
At the beginning of the lecture, I gave the students a short presentation about team-based learning, summarizing both my expectations towards them (preparation, working in groups, taking more responsibility for their own learning) and towards myself (using more time to prepare exercises, make sure to give feedback on concepts that are unclear).

First, students first took the quiz individually and had 6 minutes to do it. Upon completion of the quiz, they only got to know whether their answers were right or wrong. In the latter case, they were not informed of the correct answer. Then, they took the same quiz in groups, where they also had 6 minutes to complete it. Here are the results for both quizzes.

It is clear that students performed better as groups (6.4 &plusmn 1.6 points) than individually (2.5 &plusmn 1.6). Ideally, this improvement would be caused by some students in the group knowing some of the answers, and explaining them to the other members of the group. However, the improvement could also be cause by students simply memorizing which answers were wrong and choosing a different one. Students would also do better if they got a chance to retake the individual quiz.

After the quizzes were over, I held a short (20 min) lecture explaining the concepts necessary to answer all questions correctly. I used a bit more time on the questions with the lowest proportion of right answers.
Up to this point we had used ~45 min.

#### 3. Team Application Activities ####
After a short break, I presented to them two 3-part questions that they should answer in groups, by using the textbook. They had 15 min to answer each of the questions and email me the answers. After each question, I used a few minutes to go give them feedback on what answer would be expected if this was an exam question.

During the team activities I walked around the auditorium to observe and listen how the groups worked.  Most groups handed in their answers quickly and used the rest of the allocated time to socialize. However, looking over their answers I realized that they were quite succint. Mostly, they were lists of bullet points. Here I should have made the tasks more detailed, making it clear what I expected: paragraphs (a minimum number of words?) and figures. I will try this next time.

### Conclusions and outlook ###
Overall, this lecture format was more entertaining, both for the students and me. I genuinely enjoyed preparing the questions and exercises beforehand. It appeared that the students welcomed a different lecture format and most of them were engaged in discussions within the groups.

I will request feedback on the TBL lecture format at the end of the semester, and hopefully that (and the exam results) will give me a hint as to whether I should stick to this lecturing format, trying to improve or go back to traditional lectures.
