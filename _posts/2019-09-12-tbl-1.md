This semester I am lecturing biochemistry for the second time ever. Last year I opted for giving traditional lectures, where I presented and explained concepts for 2x45 min. The most interaction we had was me asking sporadic questions to a confused classroom. 

After attending a [very interesting course](https://falkr.github.io/tbl/) on Team-Based Learning (TBL) by Frank Kraemer, I decided to implement some of those concepts in my new lectures.

### What is TBL? ###

#### Teams ####
The central aspect of TBL is that students work in teams of 5-7 students formed by the teacher. The teams should stay constant throughout the semester.

### Course Design ####
1. **Preparation.** Students prepare individually by using a number of resources (book chapters, videos, etc.)
2. **Readiness Assurance.** The level of preparation is tested first by an individual test, and then by the exact same test taken in groups. After the tests, the instructor can focus on the concepts that are most unclear or difficult, by going through them in the form of a short (ca. 20 min) lecture.
3. **Team Application Activities.** Groups go through a number of activities where they apply knowledge gathered during preparation. The level of difficulty should be high and the tasks should be relevant and specific.
