Our latest paper “The carbohydrate-binding module and linker of a modular lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase promote localized cellulose oxidation” was finally published on the 24th of August on [JBC](http://www.jbc.org/content/early/2018/07/02/jbc.RA118.004269.abstract). 

Here, I try to provide a highlight of our findings.

LPMOs are enzymes that naturally break down cellulose, chitin and many other polysaccharides. This makes them interesting both scientifically, because cellulose and chitin are famously stable and hard to break down, and industrially, because cellulose is a great non-food raw material to produce bioethanol.

Someday, I aim to include a glossary in this blog with an overview of  info about cellulose, chitin and carbohydrate-active enzymes in general.

Essentially, in the paper we learned how an enzyme known as lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO for short) breaks down cellulose when it has an “anchor” known as a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM for short) keeping it near the cellulose surface.

##### *CBM (orange) bound to cellulose surface (green). The CBM is connected to the LPMO (blue) through a linker (cyan). The theoretical area available to the LPMO is shown in an orange shade.*

Since there are also LPMOs that do not have anchors, we studied the enzyme with and without it’s “anchoring” CBM. Enzymes that contain several parts, such as this LPMO-anchor, are called modular, as each part represents a module. This enzyme has three modules: An LPMO module that breaks down cellulose, a linker module connecting the LPMO and CBM modules together, and a CBM module that anchors to cellulose. The Enzyme without “anchor” has only one module: the LPMO module.

### Observation 1 – an “anchored” LPMO releases shorter cellulose fragments
We observed that after treating cellulose with the the enzyme with the “anchor”, short, soluble fragments were preferentially released. This was not the case for the enzyme without the “anchor”. Here, the distribution of released fragments was more random, with both short and long fragments.

### Observation 2 – the linker between the LPMO and its “anchor”/CBM is flexible and extended
In parallel, we also characterized how the enzyme with CBM moves, by using NMR spectroscopy. What we saw is that both the LPMO and CBM parts have a regular and stable structure, the linker part does not. Now, the linker can be though of as the “chain” holding the LPMO to the CBM, but it is more than that. We actually observed that the linker is not only flexible, but it also provides a certain distance between the CBM and the LPMO part. This can be observed in the [video](http://www.jbc.org/content/suppl/2018/07/02/RA118.004269.DC1/138564_1_supp_158398_pmqdm9.mov]).

### Conclusions
From these two observations we concluded that the CBM must act as an “anchor”, keeping the enzyme in place on the cellulose surface. The release of shorter fragments from the “anchored” enzyme can be explained by a localization of the enzyme’s activity on the surface. However, this localization would not be possible unless the linker or “chain” is flexible, which we also confirmed.

This is our model to explain how modular LPMOs work. It can be summarized in the figure above, but a more direct analogy is that of a tether-ball game: The CBM or “anchor” is the post, the linker is the rope and the LPMO enzyme is the ball, going around the anchoring point, breaking down cellulose bond by bond.

#### <ins>Disclaimer:</ins> Even though I’ve used the word “anchor” to describe the behavior of the CBM-module, this is not entirely accurate. The CBM binds very tightly to the cellulose surface, but is never fully fixed on one place on the cellulose and we still don’t know whether it might displace after a few reactions have taken place.*
