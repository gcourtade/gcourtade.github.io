We have solved the NMR structures of two lasso peptides from Amycolatopsis. The structures (PDB IDs [6XTH](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb6XTH/pdb) and [6XTI](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb6XTI/pdb)) are really knot special (because they are knots). Even though the structures were solved by CYANA, in order to perform energy minimization of the ensembles in YASARA, the isopeptide bond between G1 and E8 had to be redefined. I did this by first adding a bondbetween the N-terminal nitrogen and the carbonyl side-chain carbon, and then swapping the bond order to 2.0 for the C=O bond and 1.0 for the C-N bond.

By themselves, they have no effect on cancer cells. Together, they increase their proliferation and sensitivity to DOX. Therefore, we investigated the complex formation by NMR. Great work by Eva Madlnd, as it is not a trivial feat to titrate two peptides in DMSO at low concentrations and 1.1% 13C. Here's the 13C-HSQC's for the lasso peptides (A1 and A2) by themselves and when mixed together.

Using these data, we identified "active" residues, which where used as inputs for a  HADDOCK docking procedure. The resulting complex shows the "head" of each peptide interacting with the "tail" of the other one. While this is only one possible interaction model, we cannot rule out that they might interact in other ways and ratios.
